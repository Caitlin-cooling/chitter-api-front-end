# Chitter API Front End
This is a single page front end Twitter clone that requests peeps from a backend API.

### Getting set up
1. Clone this project `git clone https://github.com/Caitlin-cooling/chitter-api-front-end`
2. Change in to the project `cd chitter-api-front-end`

### Using this app
Run HTTP-server, then visit `localhost://8080/chitter.html`.
A user can:
- Sign up
- Sign in
- Once signed in, create a peep
- View all peeps

### Technologies used
This app is written in plain JavaScript and uses a basic HTTP-server. Session information is stored in localStorage so that the information persists until deleted.

JQuery to handle events.

Cypress has been used as the testing framework.

ESLint was used as a linter using the AirBNB style guide.

### Running the tests
Ensure that your server is running using `http-server` command in the terminal. Then run `./node_modules/.bin/cypress open` to open the Cyrpess console. Tests can be run individually or all at once.

### Structure of this challenge


### Given more time I would...
- Redo the program using TDD
- Implement update, delete and view single peeps
- Implement likes and comments
